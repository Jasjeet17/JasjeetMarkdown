# Introduction
I am a Research Scientist in **Carbon Fibre Precursor development**. It's my 6th year at CSIRO after a 5 year postdoc. I had no clue how coding worked prior to **Data School Focus** and used _Microsoft Excel_ and _Origin_ to plot. 

The dataset I have brought to Data School has multiple predictor variables which influence each other. Analysing and plotting this data was a daunting task as it would take so much time and effort. Hence, most analysis was done only on the final fibre instead of the fibres collected at each stage of processing.  


# My Project

**Goals**: Overall goal is to tidy data, visualise and communicate. The project goal is to find out the processing conditions to produce **strongest and stiffest carbon fibre** and understand the influence of each tratment zone.

**Data**: Data was collected from 14 experiments performed on pilot scale carbon fibre production line. The fibres were collected after each treatment zone and also at the end of the processing. The predictor variables in the data are _speed, temperature, zones, tension_. The response variables in the data are _strength, stiffness, diameter, elongation_. 

      
**Work plan**:  Work plan is to use subset of data and compare it. The comparison will be made not only on the final fibre but also on the fibres  collected along the process after each treatment zone.


## Preliminary results

In the first subset, 3 experiments were chosen that varied in speed of processing line. The 3 speeds were 14,22 and 30 metre/hour.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.

**Tables**
```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
#knitr::kable(head(gapminder, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
 # kable_styling("striped")
```

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Which ones have you learned since starting 
Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL

## Favourite tool (optional)

Is there a tool/package/function in particular that you've enjoyed using? Give it a special shout out here.

No prizes for guessing mine:

# My time went ...

What parts of the project took the most time and effort? Were there any surprising challenges you
encountered, and how did you solve them?

# Next steps

What further steps do you wish your project could take? Or are there any new digital skills that you
are keen to develop as a result of your involvement in the Data School?

# My Data School Experience

This poster is mostly about your synthesis project. However we would also like to hear about other
parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
