# Introduction
I am a Research Scientist in **Carbon Fibre Precursor development**. I did not know how to code prior to **Data School Focus** but was always curious to learn. My daily routine included designing and performing experiments followed by processing data and its analysis using _Origin_ and  _Microsoft Excel_. I work on a pilot scale wet spinning line which turns novel polymers into fibres and involves many predictor variables for optimisation. Large amount of data is generated from testing the fibres which makes analysis a tedious and time consuming task and a lag in feeding complete learnings of one experiment to the next.


# My Project

I am developing high quality precursors for making stronger and stiffer carbon fibres from novel polymers. Carbon fibre manufacturing consists of three steps:

- Synthesis of polymers

- Spinning of polymer solutions into precursor fibres

- Conversion of precursor fibres into carbon fibres

The final carbon fibre produced is influenced by all the variables involved in the above three steps. This makes optimisation very complex. Understanding evolution of fibre characteristics at every step along the process is important. But analysis of the collected data becomes a cumbersome task. My goal through Data School Focus is to become efficient in tidying and visualising data. My project goal is to find out the processing conditions to produce **strongest and stiffest carbon fibre** and understand the influence of each treatment zone. My data was collected from 14 experiments performed on a commercial precursor using pilot scale carbon fibre production line. The fibres were collected after each treatment zone and also at the end of the processing. The predictor variables in the data were _speed, temperature, zones, tension_. The response variables in the data were _strength, stiffness, diameter, elongation_. I have only used a subset of my data for this poster. 

```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = T}
#knitr::kable(head(Jilin_carbonisation_July_2019JK, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "A table of data") %>% 
 # kable_styling("striped")
```

# Visualisation of data using `ggplot2`

Evoution of fibre properties (strength) was studied during conversion of precursor fibre into carbon fibre. In the first subset, 3 experiments were chosen that varied in speed of processing line. The 3 speeds were 14(exp 1),22 (exp 2) and 30 (exp 3) in metre/hour. It can be seen that with the change in line speed both strength and stiffness change from Zone 1 to Zone 4 in the oxidation process and then at the carbonisation process this change is not obvious or the difference seems to be lost at the final fibre collection point.

Your figure and table captions are automatically numbered and can be referenced in the text
if needed: see eg. Table \@ref(tab:mytable) and Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot)

It can be seen from the graphs that although there doesn't appear to be difference in strength of final carbon fibre after carbonisation, there does appear to be difference in fibre properties when I fibre was evolving through oxidation process. This should be statistically tested in the next step.


# My Digital Toolbox

- `tidyverse` for programming
- `ggplot2`for visualisation
- `Knitr` and `KableExtra` to create this html document



## Favourite tool 

Some of my favourite functions are `str()`,`filter()`. I enjoyed using `ggplot2`

# My time went ...

I easily sailed through the lesson days and activities but I was nervous on practical days while working on my own data set, especially when I encountered problems. The helpers and instructors were extremely knowledgable and patiently solved the queries. One of the challenge in my data set was inconsistent white space.  

# Next steps

Data school has given me skills to manage my data and to be able to return to it and reuse it. I would like to polish my R skills down the track. 

# My Data School Experience

Data School Focus was a great learning experience. I enjoyed all aspects of data management including tidying, visualisation and creating a markdown document for communication. I am excited that the skills I have learnt will allow me to automate my analysis and will save me time. I will be able to

parts of your Data School experience. What aspects of the program did you really enjoy? How have you
been applying the skills you have learned in your daily work? Have you been able to transfer this 
knowledge to your team members? Concrete examples demonstrating this would be useful here
(meetings/talks/collaborations/new roles). Any descriptions of the personal impact the program has 
had are welcome here as well!
